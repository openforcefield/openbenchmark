# Test loading from directory containing a mix of SMILES and SDF molecules (only consider the SMILES

# Test loading from a directory containing molecules with different group IDs (separate output by group)

# Test on a molecule with missing parameters in ONE FF, but not another

# Test on a molecule that fails AM1BCC
